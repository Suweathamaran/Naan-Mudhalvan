Project Overview

This project, Laptop Request Catalog Items, focuses on developing an automated system using ServiceNow to replace the traditional manual laptop request process in organizations.
The existing system relied on emails or verbal communication, causing delays, miscommunication, and tracking difficulties.

By designing a Service Catalog Item within ServiceNow, the team created a dynamic, interactive form that allows employees to submit laptop requests efficiently.
The solution incorporates UI Policies, Client Scripts, Flow Designer, and Notifications to ensure automation, transparency, and data accuracy throughout the request lifecycle.

Objectives
To automate the laptop request process using ServiceNow ITSM.
To create a dynamic and user-friendly Service Catalog item.
To ensure workflow-based approvals and fulfillment tracking.
To enable notifications and audit trails for governance.
To enhance user experience with form reset and conditional field visibility.

System Implementation Summary

Catalog Item: “Laptop Request” created under IT Services.
Variables: Employee Name, Department, Laptop Type, Delivery Date, etc.
UI Policies: Implemented for dynamic field visibility based on user selections.
Client Script: Added reset form functionality.
Workflow (Flow Designer): Automated approval, fulfillment, and notifications.
Update Sets: Used for safe migration between instances.
Testing: Conducted functional, workflow, and user acceptance testing.

Architecture Overview

Layer	Focus Area	Key Tools/Components	Outcome

Key Results

Processing time reduced significantly compared to manual methods.
Data accuracy improved through UI validations and guided inputs.
Full transparency in request tracking and audit history.
Governance ensured via documented workflows and notifications.
User satisfaction enhanced through a simplified digital experience.

Testing Summary

Extensive testing was performed to validate:
Dynamic form behavior using UI Policies.
Workflow execution across roles (Employee → Manager → IT Team).
Notification accuracy for approvals, fulfillment, and closure.
Reset functionality and field validations.
Successful migration using Update Sets.

Conclusion

The Laptop Request Catalog in ServiceNow successfully transformed the manual laptop request process into a digital, automated, and transparent workflow.
It not only reduces operational burden but also ensures accuracy, speed, and user convenience.
This project demonstrates strong understanding of ServiceNow configuration, workflow automation, and ITSM best practices, setting a foundation for future asset management automation.
